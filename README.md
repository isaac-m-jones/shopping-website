This project is a client-side rendered online shopping system built using Vue.js for the frontend and Jooby for the backend REST API. Registered customers can browse products, filter by category, view product details, manage a shopping cart, and complete purchases. All data is stored and retrieved from a database using JDBI DAOs.

The system includes account registration, sign-in, session-based navigation, and a checkout workflow that records sales and updates product stock in a single transaction. All product, category, customer, and sale data is served through a set of REST endpoints.

The frontend features consistent, responsive styling, client-side input validation, and modular components (including a shared navigation menu). A UML sequence diagram is also included to document the flow for filtering products by category.
